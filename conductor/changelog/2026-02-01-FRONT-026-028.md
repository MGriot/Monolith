## Gantt: Orthogonal Connectors (FRONT-026, 027, 028)

### Changes
- Implemented **Orthogonal Hierarchy Connectors**: Dashed stepped lines from Parent Start-Left to the first Subtask Start-Left.
- Implemented **Orthogonal Dependency Connectors**: Z-shaped stepped lines from Predecessor End-Right to Successor Start-Left.
- Added **Dynamic Color Matching**: Connectors now inherit the color profile (Priority/Status) of their origin task.
- Enabled **Sharp Rendering**: Used `shapeRendering: "crispEdges"` to prevent blur on high-DPI displays.
- Integrated **1000-unit Coordinate System** for SVG precision across varied horizontal scales.

### Status
- **Verification**: Visual check performed on Gantt layout.
- **Git**: Committed.
