# Changelog: FRONT-057 - Kanban Board Refinements

**Task ID:** FRONT-057
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Author:** Ralph (AI Agent)

## Changes
- **Kanban Board:**
    - Added missing columns: "Backlog" and "On hold".
    - Implemented a display limit of 5 tasks per column to improve performance and reduce clutter.
    - Added a "+ X more" footer in columns with excess tasks.
    - **Fixed Critical DND Bug:** Resolved issue where cross-column moves were not persisting because the status change was reconciled in local state before `handleDragEnd` could trigger the API update.
    - **Precise Positioning:** Implemented `sort_index` persistence for both cross-column moves and intra-column reordering using an average-neighbor logic.
    - **Improved Rendering:** Active items being dragged are now always included in the visible list, preventing them from "disappearing" when moved to a full column.
    - Ensure `SortableContext` tracks all visible items correctly.
- **Dashboard & Stats:**
    - Updated `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` to return a full breakdown of all 6 task statuses.
    - Redesigned the Dashboard UI with a "Task Status Breakdown" grid and improved stats cards.
    - **Weighted Progress Logic:** Updated `sync_project_from_tasks` to calculate project progress based on all statuses:
        - Done: 100%
        - Review: 80%
        - In Progress: 50%
        - On Hold: 25%
        - Backlog/Todo: 0%
- **Backend Stability:**
    - Fixed `TypeError` in `CRUDProject.create` by ensuring M2M fields (topic_ids, type_ids, member_ids) are popped before model initialization.
    - Optimized move mutations to use server-returned data for immediate consistency.

## Verification
- **Manual:**
    - Check that all 6 status columns appear.
    - Create > 5 tasks in a status and verify truncation.
    - Drag tasks between all columns (including new ones) and verify status updates.
