# Changelog: CORE-001 - Model Update: Dependencies & Metadata

## Changes
- Added `DependencyType` enum (FS, SS, FF, SF) to `app.core.enums`.
- Created `Dependency` model in `app.models.dependency`.
- Added `is_milestone` (Boolean) and `deadline_at` (DateTime) to `Task` and `Subtask` models.
- Added `blocked_by` and `blocking` relationships to `Task` model linking to `Dependency`.
- Updated `app.models.__init__` to export `Dependency`.

## Verification
- Executed `backend/test_schema_check.py` which confirmed models can be instantiated with the new fields and relationships.
