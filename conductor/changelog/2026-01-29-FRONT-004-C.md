# Changelog: BACK-011 & FRONT-004-C - Master Gantt View

## Backend (BACK-011)

## Frontend (FRONT-004-C)
- Implemented `frontend/src/pages/roadmap.tsx` with a custom SVG/CSS Gantt chart.
- Supports yearly timeline view with monthly subdivisions.
- Bars colored by status (In Progress vs Completed) with progress indicators.
- Responsive scaling of project bars based on date duration.

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build`.
- Code verified for TypeScript compliance and project standards.
