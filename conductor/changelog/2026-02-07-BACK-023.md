# Changelog: BACK-023 - Team CRUD API

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Task ID:** BACK-023
**Status:** Verified

## Changes
- Created `backend/app/schemas/team.py` with Pydantic models for Team creation, update, and retrieval.
- Created `backend/app/crud/crud_team.py` implementing database logic for Teams, including member assignment and user-based filtering.
- Created `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/teams.py` exposing CRUD endpoints.
- Registered `/teams` router in `api.py`.
- Restricted Team creation, update, and deletion to system administrators.

## Verification
- Created `backend/test_team_crud.py` and executed it within the container.
- Confirmed full lifecycle: Create -> Read -> Update -> List -> Delete works correctly with member relationships.
