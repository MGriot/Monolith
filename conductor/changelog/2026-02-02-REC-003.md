# Changelog: REC-003 - Schema: Recursive Pydantic Task

## Changes
- Refactored `backend/app/schemas/task.py`:
    - Unified `Task` and `Subtask` schemas into a single recursive `Task` structure.
    - Updated `TaskCreate` and `TaskShortCreate` to allow nested subtasks during creation.
    - Added `parent_id` to all relevant schemas.
    - Used Pydantic's `model_rebuild()` to support self-referencing models.
    - Switched to `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` (Pydantic V2 style).
- Added backward compatibility aliases for `Subtask`, `SubtaskCreate`, etc., to allow gradual migration of CRUD and API logic.

## Verification
- Created `backend/tests/test_recursive_schemas.py`:
    - Verified that response model `Task` can handle 3+ levels of nesting.
    - Verified that `TaskCreate` can handle nested subtasks in the request body.
    - All tests passed.
