# Changelog: FRONT-005-B - Project Kanban Board

## Changes
- Created `frontend/src/components/kanban-board.tsx` using `@dnd-kit`.
- Implemented sortable columns for "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done".
- Integrated with `PUT /tasks/{id}` to persist status changes when cards are moved between columns.
- Added priority-based color coding for task cards.
- Optimized UI with `DragOverlay` for smooth drag feedback.

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build`.
- Drag-and-drop logic verified for cross-column movements and status persistence.
