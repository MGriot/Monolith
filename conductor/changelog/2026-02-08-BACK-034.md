# Changelog: BACK-034 - Workflow Model & API

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Task ID:** BACK-034
**Status:** Verified

## Changes
- Created `backend/app/models/workflow.py` with `Workflow` model (title, description, content, owner_id).
- Created `backend/app/schemas/workflow.py` with Pydantic models.
- Created `backend/app/crud/crud_workflow.py` with `create_with_owner` logic.
- Created `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/workflows.py` with full CRUD endpoints.
- Registered the `workflows` router in `backend/app/api/api_v1/api.py`.
- Exported `Workflow` in `backend/app/models/__init__.py`.
- Updated `backend/mcp_sync_db.py` to handle initial sync.

## Verification
- Created `backend/test_workflows_backend.py`.
- Verified full lifecycle (Create, Read, Update, List, Delete) works correctly via Docker execution.
- Verified permission logic: users can only update/delete their own workflows.
