# Changelog: FRONT-004-A - Dashboard Infra & Layout

## Changes
- Installed `@tanstack/react-query`.
- Created `frontend/src/components/layout.tsx` with Sidebar and Navigation.
- Updated `App.tsx` to wrap the application in `QueryClientProvider` and use the new `Layout`.
- Enhanced `AuthProvider` to fetch `/users/me` on mount/login.
- Defined placeholder routes for Projects, Calendar, and Roadmap.

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build`.
- Manually verified that `Layout` correctly wraps private routes and handles sidebar navigation highlighting.
