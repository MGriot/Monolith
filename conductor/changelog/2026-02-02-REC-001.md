# Changelog: REC-001 - Model: Unified Recursive Task

## Changes
- Updated `backend/app/models/task.py`:
    - Added `parent_id` column to `Task` model.
    - Updated `Task.subtasks` relationship to be self-referencing (points to `Task` with `parent_id`).
    - Added `Task.parent` relationship.
    - Modified `Subtask` model to remove `back_populates="subtasks"` to avoid conflict during migration phase.
- Updated `backend/mcp_sync_db.py`:
    - Added logic to add `parent_id` column to `tasks` table using a robust statement runner that handles existing columns and separate transactions.

## Verification
- Executed `backend/test_schema_check.py` which confirmed:
    - `Task` can now have a `parent` task.
    - `Dependency` and other models remain functional.
    - Schema sync successfully added the column in the container.
