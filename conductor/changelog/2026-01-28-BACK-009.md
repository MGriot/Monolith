- Updated `backend/app/crud/crud_task.py`:
    - Added `notify_assignees` helper.
    - Added `notify_unblocked_tasks` helper.
    - Integrated assignment triggers in `create` and `update` for Tasks and Subtasks.
    - Integrated unblocked triggers in `update` for Tasks (when status becomes DONE).

## Verification
- Created `backend/test_notifications_standalone.py`.
- Validated:
    - Adding an assignee to a task triggers a notification.
    - Completing a task that blocks another task triggers an "unblocked" notification to the blocked task's assignees.
    - Manual verification of notification API endpoints structure.
