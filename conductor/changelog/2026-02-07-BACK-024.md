# Changelog: BACK-024 - Team Activity API

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Task ID:** BACK-024
**Status:** Verified

## Changes
- Implemented `GET /api/v1/teams/activity` endpoint in `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/teams.py`.
- The endpoint:
    1. Identifies the teams the current user belongs to.
    2. Collects all other members from those teams (teammates).
    3. Fetches the most recent task completions (`completed_at != None`) by those teammates.
    4. Returns a list of activity items with task details, project context, and user information.
- Added `selectinload` for project and assignees to ensure deep loading during serialization.

## Verification
- Created `backend/test_team_activity.py` and executed it within the container.
- Confirmed that task completions by teammates are correctly fetched and formatted.
