# Changelog: BACK-029 - Team Ownership CRUD Logic

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Task ID:** BACK-029
**Status:** Verified

## Changes
- Updated `backend/app/crud/crud_team.py`:
    - Updated `get` and `get_multi` to eagerly load the `owner` relationship.
    - Updated `get_multi_by_user` to return teams where the user is either the **Owner** or a **Member** using an `OR` condition.
    - Added `distinct()` to prevent duplicate entries when a user is both owner and member (though model prevents this in members table, it's safer).

## Verification
- Created `backend/test_team_ownership_logic.py`.
- Verified that a team created with an `owner_id` correctly stores the ownership.
- Verified that `get_multi_by_user` returns the team for both the owner and the assigned members.
