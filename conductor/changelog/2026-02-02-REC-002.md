# Changelog: REC-002 - Migration: Merge Subtask Data

## Changes
- Created `backend/mcp_migrate_subtasks.py`:
    - Implemented SQL migration script to move data from `subtasks` to `tasks`.
    - Automatically resolves `project_id` from parent tasks.
    - Migrates user assignments from `subtask_assignees` to `task_assignees`.
    - Verification logic to ensure row count parity.

## Verification
- Executed migration inside the container:
    - Result: "28 subtasks existed, 28 recursive tasks now exist."
    - Migration verified successfully.
