# Changelog: FRONT-050 - Team Activity Feed

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Task ID:** FRONT-050
**Status:** Verified

## Changes
- Updated `frontend/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` to include a "Teammate Activity" feed.
- Integrated the `GET /api/v1/teams/activity` endpoint to fetch recent task completions by users in the same team(s).
- Added a responsive grid of activity cards showing task title, project, completion time, and the teammate responsible.
- Applied condition to only show the feed if teammate activity exists.

## Verification
- Ran `npm run build` - Success.
- Manual verification: Assigned two users to the same team, completed a task as one user, and verified it appeared on the other user's dashboard.
