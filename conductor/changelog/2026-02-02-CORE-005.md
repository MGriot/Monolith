# Changelog: CORE-005 - Logic: WBS Generation

## Changes
- Updated `backend/app/schemas/task.py`:
    - Added `wbs_code` field to `TaskBase` and `SubtaskBase`.
- Created `backend/app/core/wbs.py`:
    - Implemented `apply_wbs_codes` utility to dynamically assign hierarchical codes (1, 1.1, 1.2.1) based on `sort_index`.
- Updated `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/tasks.py`:
    - In `read_tasks`, the list of tasks is now processed through the WBS utility before being returned to the frontend.

## Verification
- Created and executed `backend/tests/test_wbs_standalone.py` which confirmed:
    - Top-level tasks get integer codes (1, 2, 3...).
    - Subtasks get nested codes (1.1, 1.2, 2.1...).
    - Sorting by `sort_index` is respected during code assignment.
