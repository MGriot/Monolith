# Changelog - 2026-01-30-FRONT-006-C

## Task: FRONT-006-C - Dependency Management UI

### Changes
- Created `frontend/src/components/dependency-manager.tsx` to handle task dependencies (Finish-to-Start).
- Updated `frontend/src/pages/project-detail.tsx` to display `DependencyManager` within the Task Edit Dialog.
- Integrated dependency updates with backend API (`blocked_by_ids`).
- Implemented UI to filter available tasks and prevent self-dependency.
- Verified build stability with `npm run build`.

### Verification Results
- `npm run build`: Success.
- Visual inspection: Dependencies can be added and removed within the task dialog.
