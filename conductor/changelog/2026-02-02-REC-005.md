# Changelog: REC-005 - UI: Recursive Task Tree

## Changes
- Unified Frontend Architecture:
    - Merged `Task` and `Subtask` types into a single recursive `Task` interface in `frontend/src/types/index.ts`.
- `ProjectTaskList`:
    - Refactored into a recursive table structure using `RecursiveTaskRow`.
    - Supports infinite nesting levels with incremental indentation.
    - Child tasks can be expanded/collapsed.
- `ProjectGantt`:
    - Updated `ganttItems` calculation to recursively flatten the task tree.
    - Updated hierarchy connector logic to recursively draw parent->first-child lines at all levels.
- `KanbanBoard`:
    - Updated to recursively flatten all tasks into the board columns.
- `SubtaskManager`:
    - Updated to use the unified `/tasks/` endpoint and handle `parent_id` for creating N-level children.
- `DependencyManager`:
    - Simplified to use only the `/tasks/` endpoint.
- `ProjectDetailPage`:
    - Implemented recursive flattening for the `allPossibleBlockers` list to ensure all tasks in the tree are available for selection.

## Verification
- Verified recursive WBS codes (1, 1.1, 1.1.1) in the Task List.
- Verified that moving any child in Kanban updates the entire parent chain status on the backend.
