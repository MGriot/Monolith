# Changelog: BACK-030 - Decentralized Team API CRUD

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Task ID:** BACK-030
**Status:** Verified

## Changes
- Updated `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/teams.py`:
    - `create_team`: Removed `get_current_admin` restriction. Standard users can now create teams. The `owner_id` is automatically set to the current user's ID.
    - `update_team`: Standard users can now update teams they own. Superusers retain full access.
    - `delete_team`: Standard users can now delete teams they own. Superusers retain full access.
    - `read_team`: Permission check updated to allow viewing if the user is an Admin, the Owner, or a Member.

## Verification
- Created `backend/test_team_api_logic.py`.
- Verified permission logic:
    - Owner can manage (update/delete).
    - Non-owner/non-member cannot manage or view.
    - Admin can manage everything.
    - Member can view but not manage.
