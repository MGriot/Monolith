# Changelog: FRONT-003-A - Auth Infrastructure & Routing

## Changes
- Installed `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`.
- Created `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` with Axios interceptors for JWT.
- Created `frontend/src/components/auth-provider.tsx` for global auth state.
- Configured `App.tsx` with `BrowserRouter` and basic route structure (Private/Public).

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build` with no TypeScript errors.
- Verified manual redirection logic in `App.tsx`.
