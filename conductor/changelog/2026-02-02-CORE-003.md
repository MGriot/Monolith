# Changelog: CORE-003 - Logic: Cycle Detection Utility

## Changes
- Created `backend/app/core/dependencies.py` containing:
    - `has_cycle`: A DFS-based utility to detect cycles in dependency graphs.
    - `find_cycle`: A utility that returns the specific path forming a cycle for debugging/UI purposes.

## Verification
- Created and executed `backend/tests/test_cycle_detection_standalone.py` with the following test cases:
    - No cycle (linear).
    - Direct cycle (A -> B -> A).
    - Complex cycle (A -> B -> C -> A).
    - Branching but acyclic (Diamond shape).
    - Cycle path extraction.
- All tests passed.
