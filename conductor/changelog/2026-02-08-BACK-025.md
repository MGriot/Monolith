## Task: BACK-025 - API: Project Ideas
**Status**: Verified & Committed

### Changes
- **Backend (FastAPI)**:
    - Added `IdeaStatus` enum (`Proposed`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Converted`).
    - Implemented `Idea` SQLAlchemy model with relationships to `Project`, `User` (author), and `Task` (converted task).
    - Created Pydantic schemas for `Idea` management.
    - Implemented `CRUDIdea` with specific `promote_to_task` logic that creates a new task and links it back to the idea.
    - Added `/api/v1/ideas` endpoints for CRUD operations and promotion.

### Verification Results
- **Automated Test**: `backend/test_ideas_standalone.py`
    - [PASS] Idea Creation (author assignment).
    - [PASS] Idea Promotion (Task creation + Idea status update).
