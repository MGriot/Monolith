**Monolith** is a high-performance, dockerized project management platform built for technical teams. It enforces a strict **Project → Task → Subtask** hierarchy and provides advanced high-density visualizations to turn complex roadmaps into actionable plans.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🎯 Strict Hierarchy:** Maintain absolute clarity with a 3-level structure. Subtask completion automatically drives Task progress, which in turn updates Project completion metrics.
- **📊 High-Density Visualizations:**
    - **Advanced Gantt:** Orthogonal stepped lines, dependency Z-shapes, and multi-level zoom (Day to Year).
    - **Smart Kanban:** Full status parity (Backlog to Done) with precise drag-and-drop reordering and a 5-task column limit.
    - **Activity Heatmap:** GitHub-style contribution tracking (Last 12 months rolling).
- **🤝 Decentralized Management:** Every user can create and manage their own teams, fostering organic collaboration.
- **📖 Workflow Library:** A user-managed repository for Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with full Markdown support.
- **📥 Data Portability:** High-DPI Gantt PNGs, Project CSV, and Excel (.xlsx) exports for comprehensive reporting.
- **🤖 AI-Ready (MCP):** Integrated **Model Context Protocol** server allows AI agents to autonomously manage your projects, tasks, and subtasks.
- **⚡ Technical Excellence:**
    - Manual sorting with `sort_index` (Up/Down).
    - Recursive dependency tracking and status propagation.
    - Automated weekly email summaries for users, team owners, and project owners.
    - Fully Dockerized (Nginx, FastAPI, React, Postgres).

## 🤖 MCP Integration

Monolith comes with a standalone MCP container. You can connect your favorite AI agent (e.g., Claude, Gemini) to the MCP server to automate your workflow.

**Available MCP Tools:**
- `create_project`: Generate new projects with metadata.
- `create_task` / `create_subtask`: Build out hierarchies.
- `search_projects`: Find project IDs by name.
- `update_task_status`: Real-time progress updates.
- `delete_project`: Full lifecycle management.
